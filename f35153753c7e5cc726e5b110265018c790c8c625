The real name would be \"gitiles_base__plugin\"... but I can\u0027t see this line as necessary anyway? (I tried removing it, and indeed, both in-tree and out-of-tree builds work normally.)",

      "message": "This is not working. The error is:\n\n  BUILD FAILED: Couldn\u0027t get dependency \u0027//plugins/gitiles:gitiles__plugin\u0027 of target \u0027//tools/eclipse:classpath\u0027:\n  No rule found when resolving target //plugins/gitiles:gitiles__plugin in build file //plugins/gitiles/BUCK\n\nThe cause of the error is that the name in the gerrit_plugin macro is \u0027gitiles_base\u0027 which doesn\u0027t match the plugin folder name \u0027gitiles\u0027. The gerrit_plugin macro will produce \u0027gitiles_base__plugin\u0027 but the tools/eclipse/project.py expects \u0027gitiles_base\u0027.\n\nA workaround could be to name the plugin folder also gitiles_base:\n\n  plugins/gitiles_base\n\nAfter that the tools/eclipse/project.py works.\n\nHowever, if we try to add the gitiles plugin to the list of core plugins (in the plugins/BUCK:CORE) then \"buck build release\" will fail as it will not find a gerrit_plugin(\u0027gitiles\u0027).\n\nMeans: it is not possible to list the gitiles plugin as a core plugin and at the same time have the tools/project/eclipse.py working.\n\nAny suggestion?",
