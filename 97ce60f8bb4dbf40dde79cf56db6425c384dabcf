If there were duplicates: If it\u0027s okay to return duplicates from git.getRefDatabase().getAdditionalRefs() it should be also okay to return them here, since both methods implement the same API.\n   \n3. I had checked the git history to see if deduping was the reason for adding this code, but nothing like this was mentioned.\n\n\u003e What are \"additional refs\"\n\nNon-ref items such as  MERGE_HEAD and FETCH_RESULT that are accepted by the findRef and exactRef methods.",
