      "message": "Hi! This is Zuul\u0027s specialty.  You can ask it to test this change with the one it depends on by adding this to the commit message footer:\n\n  Depends-On: https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/296022\n\nBonus: that information is helpful to reviewers as well.\n\nI pushed up a copy of this patch with that added in order to demonstrate this; you can see the tests pass there:\nhttps://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/plugins/gitiles/+/297402\n\nI didn\u0027t want to step on your toes, but if you need another revision of this patch, you might consider adding that in to the commit message.",
